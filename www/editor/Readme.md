# Show Editor

Created by Greg Brisebois

A canvas-based keyframing tool that allows for the creation of "show" files for my upcoming Raspberry Pi Christmas light animation thingy.

Inspired by, but not derived from, the work done by Marcin Ignac on his [Timeline.js](https://github.com/vorg/timeline.js).
